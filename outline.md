### Pollen Cloud
- ABV: 6.8%

#### Flavor
_Pollen Cloud_ is a lush, nectar-sweet New England-style IPA that leans fully into the floral realm.

- Primary Notes: Bursting with orange blossom honey, tangerine, and ripe cantaloupe.
- Floral Elements: Lavender, elderflower, and a soft whisper of rose petals.
- Hop Selection: A fragrant blend of Mosaic and Citra for citrus juiciness, with Cashmere and Loral layering in soft florals and a touch of melon.
- Mouthfeel: Thick and velvety with a natural sweetness that feels almost like sipping on a honeyed floral nectar. Soft carbonation keeps it plush but never heavy.

#### Look
_Pollen Cloud_ pours like tangerine juice—vivid, opaque, and glowing orange with a creamy golden haze. The head is pale ivory and soft, fading into delicate lace. The beer looks as if it were squeezed from a sunlit orchard and stirred with a bouquet of wildflowers.

#### Themes
- **A golden afternoon** in a field of wildflowers, pollen drifting on sunbeams.
- **A midsummer nap** beneath flowering citrus trees.
- **A glass conservatory**, humid with orchid blooms and citrus peels.
- **The sweetness of memory**, like childhood lemonade stands and barefoot walks through clover.
- **A dreamy haze**, where time slows down and scent and color take over.
